- âš¡ About me: I'm passionate about exploring different worlds and stories, and nothing makes me happier than diving into a good fiction book. When I'm not immersed in literary worlds, I like to express myself through the art of painting. And, of course, I can't forget my passion for programming. Learn new languages â€‹â€‹and solve challenges. These three interests - reading, painting and programming - are essential parts of what makes me who I am. Each of them provides me with a unique form of expression and helps me explore different aspects of my creativity and curiosity.
